# 12_SQL_Employee-Tracker

# Purpose
This application can be used to to build a command-line application to manage a company's employee database.

# Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). My project is to build a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. The schema is contained the following three tables:
* Department
* Role
* Employee
I have used a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries that I need to use. A constructor function or class is helpful for organizing these. I also want to include a seeds.sql file to pre-populate my database. This will make the development of individual features much easier.

# Built With
* Node.js
* Inquirer
* MySQL
